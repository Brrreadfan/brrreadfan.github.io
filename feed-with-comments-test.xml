        been used to describe a podcast or blog. In the decentralized music world, the "channel" tag could be used to descripe an album,
        a band, a label, a playlist, or more. The most common use of channels thus far has been for publishing albums, and this template
        has been designed for that particular use case. -->

            podcasts or radio shows. If you are publishing a music album or single with this feed, the tag below should remain unchanged. If you
            are publishing a playlist of other existing songs (or any other "list mediums"), you should add a capital "L" to the end of the medium

            to an online profile picture, "group" and "role" describe the person's role in the project. You can list person tags in the channel
